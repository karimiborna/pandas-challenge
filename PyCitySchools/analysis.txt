The five highest scoring schools were all charter schools and the five lowest scoring schools were all district schools.
Math scores varied by school, but were similar between all of their grades in each school. 
Reading scores were similar among all grades of all schools, with just about all of them averaging between 80-85%.
Surprisingly, schools that spent more per student averaged lower scores in both math and reading with a very direct correlation.
Small (<1000 students) and Medium (1000-2000 students) schools have very similar average scores for students across both subjects, but large schools average lower scores.
As seen in the final table, Charter schools on average have higher scoring students than District schools.
